# Getting Set Up
For the first session all you'll need is a laptop with one of the following:
1.	R and RStudio Installed
  - Click the [appropriate link here to install R](https://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/) for your operating system
  -	Click on the [appropriate installer here to install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) for your operating system 
2.	Neither of those installed but have admin privileges
  - We will install it tomorrow using the above links
3.	OR none of that but access to [IU Anyware](https://uits.iu.edu/iuanyware)
  - You can access RStudio if you search for it or use the Citrix Connection software you may have downloaded

We are going to spend the first ~3-4 sessions talking about the code from [this blog post](https://nateapathy.com/2017/12/20/how-old-is-the-senate/). In the first session we will barely touch the first couple lines of this at the bitter end.

I'll also be storing things for these sessions out on [GitHub](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bagk). We will talk about that tomorrow, too. Don't worry about knowing anything about GitHub right now. I'll invite you all to the folder so you can access it for this particular class. It will make things much easier.


# Session 1
- Installing R
- Installing RStudio
  - The relationship between RStudio and R
  - Versioning of R & RStudio - significance of software updates
- Orienting to the RStudio Screen - the four boxes, what appears, what gets saved
- Setting a working directory (build an R-dedicated folder for project files)
- R Projects & why they are important to use
- What is a package? Why do we need them?
  - Sandbox metaphor
  - Use tobit analysis package as example; not everything is developed by “default” or “included” stuff
  - They are like plugins with extra features
  - Package implications for sharing code (don’t know what packages people have, so you need the “install…” code to ensure they can do it themselves
- Introduce the first few lines of the Senate Ages R script (installing packages, commenting, loading packages)
  - [Blog post](https://nateapathy.com/2017/12/20/how-old-is-the-senate/)
  - Implications for sharing
