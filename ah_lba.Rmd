# Analysis ideas for AH LBA

**Due March 30**

Looking at plan variation in generosity within an area in a state for certain services that are high need
  
  - Using [CountyHealthRankings](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/) to find areas with high prenatal care needs, for example
    - [2017 Data](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/files/2017CHR_CSV_Analytic_Data.csv)
    - [2016 Data](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/files/2016CHR_CSV_Analytic_Data_v2.csv)
    - [2015 Data](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/files/2015%20CHR%20Analytic%20Data.csv)
    - [2014 Data](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/files/2014%20CHR%20analytic%20data.csv)
  - [BLS methodology for assessing actuarial value of the plan](https://www.bls.gov/osmr/pdf/ec150010.pdf)

Is plan generosity OR variation in plan generosity correlated with need?

**Findings are relevant in all directions**
  
  - If there is low need and no variation
    - with low value plans, OK, insurers match the need
    - with high vaue plans, not OK, insurers don't match the need
  - If there is high need and no variation
    - among low value plans; not OK, insurers don't match the need and specifically underprovide
    - with high value plans; OK, insurers match the need
  - If there is low need and variation
    - Insurers are offering clearly dominated plans given the need
  - If there is high need and variation
    - Insurers are offering clearly dominated plans given the need
