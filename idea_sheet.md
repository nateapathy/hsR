*doc for jotting down ideas for lesson planning as they come up*
# Future Ideas
- data management, cleaning data, using multiple data sets
- exploratory data analysis, describing data
- basic statistical procedures & tests (t-tests, chi-sq, anova, etc.)
- Regression assumptions review
- different regression models we are likely to use/encounter
- statistical designs for causal inference
- machine learning/statistical learning/unsupervised learning (principal components analysis, cluster analysis)
- visualizations using ggplot2
- web scraping, being creative re: data sources, word clouds

# Assignments/Tasks
- use issues with common prompt and different per-person tasks
  - then each person can pull in the data the same, be equal there, but then have to execute something specific to them and then share back to the issue thread
