# DAGs in R & Review of Confounding
- ggdag package - this is brand new and not well-developed, but it's what we have and can be useful!
```{r}
dagified <- dagify(x ~ z,
                   y ~ z,
                   exposure = "x",
                   outcome = "y")
tidy_dagitty(dagified)
ggdag(dagified, layout="circle")
```
