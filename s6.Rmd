# Regression Assumptions

1. Model is linear in the parameters
2. Samples are independent and random (implies no serial correlation in the errors)
3. No perfect collinearity in the regressors
4. Zero conditional mean of the error (expected value of residual is 0)
5. Homoskedasticity of the error terms
6. Errors normally distributed
7. No serial correlation in the errors
8. Non-zero sample variance in x
